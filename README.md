# LZWCompression
A project that performs Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) compression on a number of files.

There are two LZW files, one containing the implementation of the Sedgewick and Wayne of Algorithms: Fourth Edition, ```LZW.java```, and one containing my modifications, ```LZWmod.java```. An analysis of these two programs is available in ```Analysis.docx```.
